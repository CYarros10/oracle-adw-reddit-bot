I am only 3 months in and while I feel mostly ramped up, I also feel like I am just coasting and collecting a paycheck.\t2018-12-17 20:02:31\t0.0347222222222222\t0.394664547359686\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tMy wife and I stopped at Burger King on our way to Philadelphia this past summer and it was good but I felt weird afterward.\t2018-12-17 20:04:04\t-0.0166666666666667\t0.649715719659463\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tYeah for sure. Scorsese's worst film (at least that I've watched).\t2018-12-17 20:25:03\t-0.266666666666667\t0.170234990075898\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tI am glad I didn't watch it. I honestly lost faith in the series after the AVP movies.   If the Alien 5 project with Hicks would have come to be I would have changed my course, but it just seems like a mess at this point.\t2018-12-17 20:23:41\t0.16875\t0.335658738925149\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tIt would have been better on its own. I wish the series would have stopped with Aliens (same goes for Terminator and T2).\t2018-12-17 20:13:49\t0.366666666666667\t0.234227965600965\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tYes it was. My wife and I felt exhausted afterward. It was way too fucking long and a lot of it was boring.\t2018-12-17 20:13:18\t-0.483333333333333\t0.352949945218108\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tlmao\t2018-12-17 20:18:16\t0.6\t0.5\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tI did this a few years back at my last job. I loved it.\t2018-12-17 20:33:10\t0.125\t0.780565210716222\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tDefinitely. Being in my early thirties it's definitely the norm/par for the course, and being able to see friends a few times a year is the norm, unlike my 2s. I think most of us are very busy and in NYC, for instance, it's easy for people to disappear into their own worlds, which is good and bad depending on the relationship.   One of my buddies and I haven't seen each other in over a year, and we used to work together and hang regularly, but he and I are in very different places.\t2018-12-17 20:32:36\t0.138452380952381\t0.997522060572573\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tYeah neither did I.

The first two films were borderline comedies.\t2018-12-17 20:26:18\t0.375\t0.40297900735664\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tMe too thanks\t2018-12-17 20:30:11\t0.2\t0.586889734856074\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tAnother regular at my Dolphins bar informed us he's moving away this winter. I know I mentioned this a week or so back but after 7 years with the club and watching the regulars come and go there aren't too many of us left, and I have made a conscious effort to go there for as many games as possible despite being in the suburbs now. I am sure when more life changes happen on my front in the next year or so I will go there even less, and soon it will become an annual thing just as it has become with friends back home or those that are dispersed for various reasons.   It's an aspect of getting older I truly hate, not matter how much we have to accept it. \t2018-12-17 20:29:06\t0.09375\t0.989656063799397\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tI've racked up so much karma since my last job ended in August.

It was nice to be there last night and with Christmas in the air it feels magical during this time of the year, but I am sure I'd grow bored if I lived there. I'd rather live in the West Village, Gramercy or the Upper West Side in the 7s near the park.\t2018-12-18 20:48:57\t0.167045454545455\t0.953304967938116\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tNo, no I appreciate the free internet points XD\t2018-12-18 20:49:17\t0.4\t0.716033972937049\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tGood thing we have a trade guru in the White House!\t2018-12-17 21:43:19\t0.35\t0.542767723162611\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tHaha I am not that bored.   Saw a TIFU post about some dude sending a Snap of himself jerking off to a group chat at his job.

Those are all solid choices. I think of the three Gnocchi ala Sorrentina is my favorite.

It does go well with my username, and all good.

They were fairly competitive in the mid to late '9s but never a serious threat beyond their Super Bowl run in 1996. Going into 21 following a 5-11 season in a highly competitive AFC East no one saw a potential dynasty coming.   In the late '9s and early 2s the AFC East frequently sent multiple teams to the playoffs. It was a very different division back then.\t2018-12-18 15:34:43\t0.0685714285714285\t0.988088375202487\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tI love pasta\t2018-12-18 15:36:38\t0.5\t0.781705539358601\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tYou, too!

In the case of MLB, the Cardinals and Cubs agreed to remain together and wanted to play in the NL East, which meant the Braves and Reds, despite being geographically more eastern than Chicago and St. Louis, were forced to play in the NL West. As was the case with the NFL, the league didn't want to break up the already-established NFC Central and NFC East. \t2018-12-18 17:25:29\t0.06\t0.992377273060316\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tMy last company made a point to always order them on tap.

A week after I moved into my new house I was let go. Thankfully, a friend came through and I was able to land a new job soon after and my new mortgage was not affected.   You should ditch the idea of working from home and start working on finding a new gig ASAP, especially if you want to move forward with closing on your house. Hit up as many people as you know and take whatever related opportunity you can get. The key is to acquire stability and rid yourself of a toxic situation, especially when you're in the process of purchasing a new home.   Keep us posted and good luck! If you absolutely cannot swing a new gig, don't close on the new house.\t2018-12-18 19:56:04\t0.167424242424242\t0.999974673404659\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tEnjoy it man!\t2018-12-18 19:58:52\t0.5\t0.622876896276403\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tHe looks like that intimidating suburban soccer dad whose wife blows most of their budget on manicures and haircuts while he's looking for a second job to keep food on the table.\t2018-12-18 19:57:56\t0.166666666666667\t0.36606991954998\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tHahaha oh man.

I mean, I don't hate all of those bands and there are some good songs in there, but overall it was a terrible period for rock after most of the great acts from the '6s and early to mid '7s broke up or declined. I might hate the post-grunge shit from my high school years more.\t2018-12-19 21:51:55\t-0.0271153846153846\t0.997761071060792\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\t> CITIZEN SOLDIER  I hate that fucking song. I heard it all too often. It all sounded the same and while I admit I liked Three Doors Down at first, their act got old really quickly. Same goes for Puddle of Mudd and some of those other bands.   I liked some Bush and some Collective Soul, but overall it was a really lackluster period for rock music. Fuel and Live had some decent stuff but it was overplayed.\t2018-12-19 21:55:14\t0.0266053391053391\t0.974091624778164\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tYeah I liked them and there were exceptions.

The dude has always loved to drive and with four degrees, he now trucks for a living.   Don't be my friend. If you're that indecisive, don't waste that much time in undergrad and grad school to ultimately drive trucks for a living (no offense to truckers).\t2018-12-20 03:54:35\t0.2375\t0.116458367117096\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tMy dog loves human food and we primarily only give him the following: rice (his favorite), some turkey and cheese, bananas (also loves), blueberries, strawberries, cantaloupe, watermelon and Pirate's Booty.

My mom and her husband adopted her about 6-7 years ago. She's come a long way. The second cat that adopted after our longtime family cat passed was basically stuck in a cage for most of his life and mistreated by his foster family, so he has issues jumps. I need to get out to Colorado and see Lucy and meet the boy cat, Loki.   Haha that's pretty awesome.

It's really none of my business but I am sure it was a combination of loans and family assistance.   Haha I love driving but could not do it for a living. The road trip back to Kansas from NYC was a blast and I am glad my wife had fun and wants to do it again in a few years. I get it, though, as driving isn't for everyone.\t2018-12-20 04:08:11\t0.27\t0.976203351258746\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tUnderstandable. Growing up my family wasn't too well-off and a lot of our cars were unreliable up until a certain point when they began earning more money. My first car was an Oldsmobile and it was terrible.   Motorcycles are fucking sweet. Not for me but I respect them and love riding on them.\t2018-12-20 04:16:30\t0.173469387755102\t0.311934905321989\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tI agree. I just wish he would have pursued it sooner. He was in school for 12-13 years. He seems happy and gets to travel a lot on the road, which he loves, but I can't imagine how much money he spent on his academic adventures.   Yeah it's hard work. He said he nearly got fired and it freaked him out. I couldn't handle it.\t2018-12-20 03:59:50\t0.118055555555556\t0.662319395314987\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tThat's really awesome! Haha. What inspired you to study it and you should try to use it again! It's a tough language (I studied Russian and Ukrainian for many years but Japanese is its own entity). \t2018-12-20 16:54:33\t0.28015873015873\t0.992683437688153\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tIt's been 5 years since I've been back to Colorado. I regret not taking a trip in the past few years, but life has been busy with something or another and I felt guilty at different points for taking off time for other trips. Looking back, I should have made a point to go there more often when I had the chance and it looks like I won't be able to for another year or so.  To those of you that aren't deep in a marriage and life stuff, take advantage of your time and if you work at a company that grants a reasonable amount of PTO or unlimited PTO, do it. You will find yourself swamped with life and realizing you haven't been somewhere you live in 4-5 years due to life shit. \t2018-12-20 16:56:33\t0.00242424242424243\t0.92072692404888\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tHaha oh yeah.

It took me several months to get used to Cyrillic.   My friend is living in Germany and trying to learn German and is having a hell of a time.

A lot of management teams will monitor it, too, and protected people can easily abuse it.

My last company moved to unlimited PTO when they were having serious financial issues. The company was also terrible about promoting time off, so when people had previously quit, they typically had 1+ days of unused PTO. \t2018-12-20 17:07:30\t-0.277777777777778\t0.391914496409489\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tRight on and glad to hear.

Kids everywhere wore the clothes, wanted to be a Disney princess or Lion King character, owned the toys and most of them spawned cartoon spin-offs. They were popular for so long and hard to miss. \"The Lion King\" felt like the cherry on top during that run.  \"Toy Story\" was popular and beloved, but didn't have that same impact. \t2018-12-20 17:44:42\t0.274679487179487\t0.999328138889076\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tI hope she has no small children or pets. \t2018-12-20 17:48:51\t0.125\t0.645363023240795\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tYes!

I can't do those three cuisines all the time for lunch.\t2018-12-20 18:00:11\t0.00952380952380953\t0.444615646673444\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tYeah dude I was super fast this morning, but didn't have time to make a coffee or eat breakfast. I need coffee soon but our lunch is late.   Sounds pretty sweet dude. I love finding such deals, and it sounds like you need some serious time away from your computer.

I watched it on the big screen and enjoyed it, but I found myself hating most of the characters. I loved The Lion King and rooted for most of the characters, and it was released at the right time. I also thought it had a bigger impact on kids.\t2018-12-20 17:41:29\t0.287276785714286\t0.992522138872082\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tYeah definitely.

Better to take advantage of your time than waste it at your cube, and my bus stop is a few minutes from my house. The 9 am bus was late so we all had to take the 9:15. I was surprisingly here a little after 1:2.\t2018-12-20 17:39:27\t0.130357142857143\t0.0457030236649306\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tAnd other past NFL players that became actors (Merlin Olsen, Dick Butkus, etc).

I am going to order some wine and cheese baskets for my mom and her husband and sisters, but I may do something else for my sisters and their kids (not sure at this point). \t2018-12-20 17:32:12\t-0.125\t0.618682652891934\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tStella irks me, too. It's advertising as a prestigious beer when in fact it's an international step up from Budweiser or Coors.   An Irish pub near my office with a rooftop used to sell it for $9-1 a cup. I will only drink Stella when it's cold and free.\t2018-12-20 17:14:58\t-0.0166666666666667\t0.948165080016222\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tHaha thank you. I have a little bit from my maternal great-grandmother's side. I am mostly German, Irish, Mexican and English with some Hungarian and Polish in the mix.\t2018-12-20 14:31:20\t0.00208333333333333\t0.979871196373764\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tThank you for the kind words!

In my case, it's just an alias I've used for about 1 years in honor of Imre Lakatos.   That's a great mix. The Irish mix well with anyone. Polish and Hungarian women tend to be very pretty, too.\t2018-12-20 14:35:01\t0.375\t0.504263197752696\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tIt may have just been certain areas where she went. \t2018-12-20 19:26:14\t0.214285714285714\t0.403049254164424\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tHaha I love this\t2018-12-20 19:27:30\t0.35\t0.539952593582308\nmisterlakatos\tnfl\tWell said.

Always being on is a waste of battery power and raise-to-wake renders it unnecessary. Swiping up to go to the home screen is as quick and easy as pressing the home button so it is equally or less cumbersome as TouchID in most situations. It's fairly seamless after FaceID has had time to learn your face. I have require attention turned on with my iPhone X and it will unlock when I am half asleep and 1/3 of my face is covered by my pillow. My eyes aren't even fully opened. After it's had thousands of unlocks and a number of corrections via failing to unlock (usually when viewed at extreme angles or partially covered face) followed by immediately inputting the correct passkey which causes it to incorporate the failed image going forward it is as seamless as Apple intended. I tested it out using a photo of myself and it rejected it every time. I let a couple of people try to unlock it when I first got it and it never had a false positive although that's not exactly exhaustive testing.  As for the idea of it being easier to go to the home screen first, that's extra work. The phone is fairly tall and for right-handed people requires a second hand or shifting it to the left hand because swiping down from the left side of the notch (and only the left side, the right side opens the control panel) brings down the notifications. And pressing the notification you want to deal with lets you go directly to it so you don't have to waste time going to the home screen first. There are really only a few bad scenarios with FaceID compared to TouchID and it's better in most situations. The main bad situation is trying to unlock it with require attention turned on while driving and strong direct sunlight blinds the sensor.\t0.0142733959807131\nnews\tvinnymcapplesauce\t>YouTube in Safari with the content blockers  Yeah, that's what I do on mobile.

There are reports of iPhone X having Wi-Fi issues online stemming all the way back from last December, however since a sizable sum of households don't have a Wi-Fi network that is capable of running under the 5. Ghz band, the issue mostly went under the radar. For a few years now Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity have been bundled into one module for iOS devices without issue, but seeing as iPhone 8 and iPhone X were the first devices to have Bluetooth 5. capabilities, there must have been some oversight in the chip design which resulted in less efficient connectivity for users.\t0.0958333333333333\nAskReddit\tsam_hammich\tMy buddy used to do the little \"twirl\" thing you might do idly with your phone, thumb on the back and middle finger on the front and you kinda spin it while \"flicking\" it away from you.

Point is, yes, sometimes your battery will be great. Other times it'll suck. This is all because of the way Google handles data harvesting.    For now? I used Android since 21.

Yes companies will try to preserve their profit as best they can, but if transferring the taxes ultimately costs them more because of decrease of sales, they will just suck it up and accept a smaller decrease of their profit.  Besides, even if they raise their prices, this will mean a larger chunk of the revenues will actually remain in French economy, as opposed to being siphoned out to Ireland and then elsewhere, so it's better for France nonetheless.

If you were saying it's 8.3 mm thick on the bump, then ok, sure, at that point it would be an argument of what you prefer (I prefer thicker without bump). But it being SO big makes no sense. It's still way more than the thickness of the S9+.  Also, the weight part, the S9+ is in the middle of the weight of the Xs and Xs MAX. And the screen size is in between as well. So it seems that there's no big effect on that since it seems to be more related to screen size and overall size than the thickness.\t0.122527472527473\ninvesting\tShawnTHEgreat\tDid it fall more ham the general market this week?

Not every design decision Apple makes is the right one, and not every design decision Samsung, LG, ZTE, or any other manufacturer makes is the wrong one either.  Putting a case around your phone to protect it from scratches and superficial scuffing is perfectly reasonable advice, and ranting as you have only demonstrates that you just don't know what you're talking about. You've made one statement in particular which exemplifies this:  >The front glass of the iPhone X hasn't scratched at all from going in and out of my pocket. So they clearly CAN put glass on the back that would protect from that.  Let's extrapolate from that example, shall we?  \"The glass windows in my house don't have the pitting or abrasions that the glass in my car's windshield has, so clearly the people who make my car's windshield CAN use glass that would protect from that.\"  Do you see it yet? Here, try this one:  \"The metal used in manufacturing my car doesn't protect against rust as well as the metal used in my frying pan, so clearly the people who make my car CAN use metal that would protect from that.\"  Get it now?  Apple, like EVERY phone manufacturer, uses different kinds of glasses for the front as they do the back. Why? Because the front of the phone has different requirements from the glass on the back of the phone. For example, the glass on the front of the phone has to be optically clear, and has to deform and rebound from mild and gentle pressure (fingers pressing and tapping), while the glass on the back of the phone has to have greater resistance against sudden impacts (plopping the phone down on a table, for example) and has to help dissipate heat. When you engineer glass for a specific task, there are trade-offs. A more flexible glass, for example, might be more resistant to cracking but less resistant to abrasions. There is no \"wunderglass\" that can do all of those things.  >The Apple Watch uses a higher grade coating on it's stainless steel which is why it won't begin to shed, or possibly never will.  And that coating may be more expensive to apply, or may adversely affect the greater heat dissipation requirements of the iPhone, or may not be able to be used in the iPhone manufacturing process. *Not everything can be used everywhere else.*  \"Bendgate\" is a different animal altogether. Yes, Apple's poor engineering (IMO) is to blame for those bends; I straighten more 6 and 6 Plus frames than any other phone.

Now it is impractical to do that each time or to crop in on a wide angle photo from 2ft and end up with a blurry shot like you said but the main point is the focal length is not the factor that causes this type of distortion with the subject in the center of the frame.  Now I understand the article was trying to demonstrate what effect the lens has on a person's face but they fail to mention the difference in distance until the end and gloss over it.

The Roku version of Netflix plays 4k, and so does the YouTube app so there is no loss in quality using this over my Apple TV.  All the apps on my Roku TV are just as responsive and fast as the Apple TV counterparts in my experience. The Roku even has the same search features that the Apple TV has where you can search for a name of something and it will show what services you can watch it on. The Roku takes it a step further and suggests other services that I might not already have downloaded on my TV to watch whatever I searched for on.  The Roku also has an iPhone app that allows for easy typing on menus just like the Apple TV app for iPhone does, and you can navigate the TV just like the Apple TV using the Roku Remote.

That's why you don't really see the big names developing rugged phones anymore (not that most of them did, but I'm pretty sure Samsung had rugged feature phones).

According to the article: Sentient: 1: responsive to or conscious of sense impressions: sentient beings. 2: aware 3: finely sensitive in perception or feeling (Merriam-Webster)  By that definition any iPhone is sentient.   The fact is we dont know if anyone else is sentient, and it doesnt make a difference to our interaction with others. If Google made the perfect chatbot to make phone appointments, will it really matter if its sentient?\t0.178571428571429\napple\tabedfilms\tExcept that's not how ram works. If you put in 3gb ram, the phone isn't going to run faster.  Ram is temporary storage. So as long as your open apps use less ram than available, then speed depends on other factors like processor speed and app optimization, not quantity of ram.   Only when you run out of ram does it get slow.  So if you have apps taking up 8gb ram, then you can bet that the OnePlus is going to be able to handle it and the iPhone won't be able to.  The 1gb of ram isn't to run things faster, it's the ability to have sufficient memory to handle a ton of apps using memory. \t0.0842592592592593\napple\tmobani\tStill does not excuse the cheap material used for the iPhone X chassis.

No offense in any way but your reasoning can actually be detrimental since it perpetuates the myth that many Americans have of China's role in manufacturing of being merely cheap labor and low-end skill. Companies do not choose China because of the low currency exchange. It may play a role but sole relying on exchange rates are too volatile to actually sustain any long-term investment presence of manufacturing. And it's not like China is the only country that tries to do this considering that a myriad of other countries including Japan rely on exports ([https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/forex/us-adds-india-to-currency-watch-list-with-china/article23537375.ece](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/forex/us-adds-india-to-currency-watch-list-with-china/article23537375.ece)). If it were so easy a good question to ask is why don't companies move all their manufacturing to places with even cheaper labor now like Vietnam or India?   &#x2B;  People need to see first-hand the scale, capacity, and sheer infrastructure of China's manufacturing to fully appreciate it's capability. Belittling or brushing away the truth doesn't solve anything and actually undermines effective actions that can be taken because the populace misunderstands the real reasons. China dominates manufacturing because over the decades it has built up the technical expertise and operational acumen to produce or assemble products at the scale with which the world demands and at the low price which the majority of consumers want. The former point is very important because it is the most misunderstood aspect. The truth is that only China at this point has the scale to churn out those assembled iPhones for example to meet global demand and thereby optimize Apple's earnings. And many important components in various electronics are made in China as well, so it's not like everything is made from other countries as the original post seems to imply. It makes a portion of an electronic device's components and assembles this along with other parts from other countries to the finished product. People seem to think this is some easy straightforward operation which is indicative of their ignorance in global manufacturing. You cannot just bring all this to other countries because they don't have the infrastructure, personnel expertise, technical capacity, and operational knowledge to do this.\t0.148904761904762\nworldnews\tMrGraeme\tThe problem is that the article deals with nominal wealth, which does not factor in purchasing power. The author is comparing the nominal wealth controlled by the top 1% to the nominal wealth controlled by the 99%.  The issue with this is that nominal threshold for someone to be in the top 1% is an income of ~$34k. This is problematic as it does not take purchasing power into account. Someone living in a high income country or region such as Norway or Los Angeles likely won't get very far on a gross income of $34k- they wouldn't be considered \"rich\" by any practical standard, but they would still fall into the top \"1%\" of global earners. At the same time, if someone is living on a gross income of $34k in a poorer region such as Poland, their increased purchasing power would make them relatively richer.   >Nominal rates matter, however, when you consider trade. A person saving 1% of their income in LA can go vacation on a Greek island resort where a person saving 1% of their income in Greece couldn't afford it. A person in SF can spare 1 week's rent money to buy an iPhone, or save for a year's rent and buy a new German car, where a Pole would have to be save much more to get these goods - even if both can afford the same lifestyle in terms of affording locally-produced goods like housing and food.  This is the issue, the article is *not* dealing with PPP rates. It's comparing nominal amounts, meaning someone earning $34k/year in Los Angeles is treated the same as someone earning $34k/year in Warsaw. The problem with this is that, due to differences in purchasing power, the person in Warsaw earning $34k/year(nominal) is going to end up feeling a lot wealthier than the person in Los Angeles earning the same. \t0.116363636363636\nAskReddit\tiAMnotAtrollTODAY\t>Androids aren't necessarily bad, but require someone with some technical knowledge to know how to sift out the shit phones  If you buy any android flagship phone you are getting a quality product.
